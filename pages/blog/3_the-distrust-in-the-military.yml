title: 'The Distrust In The Military'

text: "<p>My time in the US Army was easily one of the most rewarding experiences I will ever have in my life; it forced me to mature quicker than I may have wanted to, it enabled me to travel and enjoy a small portion of what the world offers, and it helped me to find something I was truly passionate about in development. &nbsp;Even with all of the good things that came about from that experience, the fact is that there is quite a bit about the military culture that isn&#39;t as great as people would like to believe. &nbsp;A recent story going around the internet highlights one of the issues plaguing the military service; a distrust of those you serve with.</p>\n\n<h3>The &quot;Hot&quot; Story</h3>\n<p>At some point during my last unit&#39;s deployment to Afghanistan, my company&#39;s Rear Detachment NCOIC had sent an e-mail to several Soldiers after finding a post on Facebook which she found offensive and contradictory to the Army Values and how we as Soldiers are trained to behave. &nbsp;Many, including myself while I wore those boots, will argue that what you say or do during your off time is your own opinion and isn&#39;t something the military has control over. &nbsp;The fact of the matter is that you really don&#39;t have the full freedom of speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment while you&#39;re serving. &nbsp;The content that was published, based on what I&#39;ve heard and read of the incident was very negative of barracks life in the military and involved people wearing the uniform in the content; their actions by displaying their military affiliation through wearing the uniform or what was on their Facebook profiles is a representation of the military and any leader who would address that issue is in the right frame of mind to do so. &nbsp;Ironically, many don&#39;t, for one reason or another.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=123850\">Department of Defense recently decided to recognize</a> 1SG Katrina Moerk, the Soldier who addressed the negative behavior. &nbsp;Immediately, a majority of Soldiers in channels I still follow went on the offensive and called her out for the manner in which she handled the situation. &nbsp;1SG responded <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vqUSJ-EHQJMJ:https://soldierbettyblogs.wordpress.com/2014/12/27/1sg-katrina-moerk-gets-arcom-for-trolling/+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us\">via a blog post</a>&nbsp;(note: this links to the Google cache due to her marking the blog as private, availability isn&#39;t guaranteed) to some of the stronger commentary. &nbsp;The long and short of it is that this entire situation and the commentary in some of those same channels demonstrates there are still a lot of trust issues in a <s>line of work</s>&nbsp;way of life where trust is a foundation of what we do on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<h3>Trust Issues</h3>\n<p>In my own career, I was generally lucky enough to work with smaller circles of Soldiers who looked out for one another. &nbsp;Over that same period of time though, I saw a lot of Soldiers who I had a difficult time trusting; seniors, peers, and subordinates alike. &nbsp;These individuals had clearly demonstrated that their careers or their individual needs took precedence to the extent of creating a negative environment. &nbsp;They had spoken in a manner that said &quot;I can be trusted&quot; but acted in a manner which made anyone who paid attention question them.</p>\n<p>The distrust I saw in the military environment that I had made my life has affected me for the worse. &nbsp;It&#39;s instilled in me a belief that it&#39;s hard to trust people, and it reflects in my behaviors. &nbsp;There are truly only a small handful of individuals I have a true sense of trust with, most of whom not affiliated with the military. &nbsp;I&#39;ve never openly admitted this before, but my worst feeling of trust while I was in the service came during my deployment to Afghanistan; in an environment where trust is at its highest requirements, I had the most difficulties putting any trust (for my military career or my life) in many of their hands.</p>\n\n<h3>The Perceptions</h3>\n<p>Personally, I didn&#39;t have this type of mistrusting relationship with 1SG Moerk. &nbsp;Truthfully, I didn&#39;t work directly with her often enough to gauge her personality or character at the same level of detail that others who I spent the final year of my military career working with had. &nbsp;However, if I were still in the military service and were either in her current unit or an inbound Sergeant and knew nothing of her but what I&#39;ve read from this story, I would have trust issues with her as a leader. &nbsp;One action specifically in response to the issue raises a big concern with me (and it is an action she noted in her blog (prior to it being marked private) that might not have been the best idea); her sending a Courtesy Copy of the e-mail to the director of the Army&#39;s <abbr title=\"Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention\">SHARP</abbr> program. &nbsp;If I did not know her and was only judging her on this story, it would raise a red flag with me as a Soldier and Noncommissioned Officer, an individual expected to lead and mentor Soldiers. &nbsp;That action alerts me that she might not be able to resolve issues at her leadership level or needs reinforcement to convey a message. &nbsp;With this perception, how can I as a subordinate to her within her unit entrust her after this incident to advise the commanding officer on matters pertaining to the Soldiers or to &quot;take care&quot; of her troops when it seems like she couldn&#39;t handle this one issue?</p>\n<p>Just so it&#39;s clear here, I am truly not trying to kill her character or suggest that those working with her question her as a leader, I am just sharing my concerns as if I did not know her and were preparing to serve alongside her; I am sharing my&nbsp;<strong>perception</strong>&nbsp;based on this incident, for better or for worse. &nbsp;The fact is, she did something that most people I&#39;ve met wouldn&#39;t do; address the creators of internet content that&#39;s offensive (not in a joking manner; there is a difference to me) and explain why what they&#39;ve created is wrong. &nbsp;Often you hear that if you don&#39;t like something on the internet to just not visit the site again or to &quot;grow a pair&quot;, but that truthfully doesn&#39;t address the underlying issues of borderline accepting behaviors online that we wouldn&#39;t in real life.</p>\n\n<h3>Moving Forward</h3>\n<p>I don&#39;t have the magic answer as to how to address these issues moving forward. &nbsp;It is an issue that everyone from the lowest Private to the highest General needs to be involved with though. &nbsp;In some ways, the military is addressing some of those issues. &nbsp;During my first years in the service, at a point when the War on Terrorism was producing high casualty rates and seeing high deployment rates of Soldiers, it wasn&#39;t uncommon to hear of Soldiers being discharged for poor behavior, which was later attributed to <abbr title=\"Post Traumatic Stress Disorder\">PTSD</abbr>, and having issues with creating a stable post-military life or to hear of Soldiers committing suicide. &nbsp;Transitional services were optional, if present, and PTSD was not a topic most were willing to discuss. &nbsp;Fortunately, today the military&#39;s transitional services are much better and more is being done to address the mental and emotional issues that the military service may cause. &nbsp;That is only one piece of the puzzle though.</p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, this post will be read by a few folks either with a military background or actively serving today. &nbsp;So I&#39;ll ask you, are you a part of the problem or are you helping to be part of the solution? &nbsp;Are you one of those Soldiers whom others have a hard time trusting as a leader, mentor, or peer; or are you someone who has earned the trust and respect of those around you and are helping to create a positive environment?</p>"
